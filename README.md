## Introduction

Hello there! Welcome to the thrilling world of Nagasaki Soyo, the dedicated and vigilant parking lot manager of a bustling, three-level parking facility. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to master the art of monitoring this complex maze of parked cars and ensure everything runs as smoothly as a freshly paved road.

## Getting Started

As the overseer of this vehicular sanctuary, you will be perched in front of the almighty monitor, your window into the automotive abyss. This is not just any monitor, but a special one that gives you the power to observe and manage the parking lot across its three sprawling levels.

### Command Line Options

- To begin your journey and learn the ropes, invoke the wisdom of the `-h` or `--help` command. This will unveil the sacred manual that guides you through the mystical commands at your disposal.
- Your shift is not eternal (thankfully), so you can set the duration of your vigilant watch by using the `-t` or `--running-time` option followed by the number of milliseconds you wish to keep an eye on the lot. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility!

### Navigating Through the Levels

As you settle into your throne of surveillance, remember that you are not bound to one level of this parking paradise. You have the power to switch your view to any of the three levels by simply pressing the corresponding number key. Yes, it's that easy!

## The Time Warp Trick

Now, let's talk about a little secret power you possess in this parking lot realm - the ability to fast-forward time itself! That's right, with the simple press of the "Right Arrow" key, you can accelerate the flow of time. Watch as cars zoom in and out at breakneck speed, and the day zips by like a race car on its final lap!

### Fast-Forward, Not Rewind

But remember, dear time-bending custodian, with great power comes great responsibility. While you can speed up time, you can't rewind it. The past is the past, a memory in the rearview mirror of your parking lot saga. There's no undo button for life, or in this case, for your parking lot adventure.

### Fixed Shift Hours

Also, a word of caution: speeding up time is fun, but it doesn't shorten your actual shift. The clock ticks on, regardless of your temporal antics. Your total working hours (i.e., the program's runtime) remain the same. So, while you may feel like a time-controlling wizard, you're still on the clock, serving your parking lot duty with diligence.

*So, when the day feels slow, and the cars seem to crawl, just hit that "Right Arrow" and watch the world fly by. Just be sure not to blink, or you might miss some parking lot action!*

## The Fantastic Fleet

In Nagasaki Soyo's parking lot, you will encounter vehicles that defy the mundane rules of ordinary parking lots. Each type of vehicle brings its own flavor of wonder and quirkiness:

### The Classic Car

Ah, the good ol' Car, the bread and butter of any parking lot. But wait, there's a twist! Each of these regular family cars proudly sports a tiny flag that wiggles up and down as if to say, "Look at me, I'm fancy!" It's not just a car, it's a car with a flag - a symbol of parking lot patriotism.

### The Mysterious UFO

Next up, we have the UFO, and no, it's not your uncle's old fishing boat. These unidentified floating objects are a sight to behold, rotating constantly as if lost in a cosmic salsa dance. Watching them can be quite hypnotic, but don't get too mesmerized - you've got a parking lot to manage!

### The Sizing Spacecraft

***"It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's the Spacecraft!"*** These cosmic vessels have a knack for dramatics - they keep zooming in and out! One minute they're tiny specks in the vast parking space, and the next, they're looming large, almost saying, "Boo!" Talk about having space issues!

### The Tantalizing Teleport

Last but not least, the Teleport is the wildcard of the lot. These aren't your everyday vehicles; they're more like parking ninjas - appearing and disappearing in a blink! Their colors shift and shimmer, and they even

*So, dear parking lot custodian, keep your eyes peeled and your wits about you. These vehicles are not here to make your shift easy, but they sure make it interesting!*

## Special Features

In this extraordinary parking lot simulation, we've sprinkled some magical touches to enhance your experience. Here are some of the special features that make our parking lot stand out:

### The Waving Flags on Cars

Each Car in our lot is equipped with a little flag that moves up and down. It's not just for show - these flags are a quirky way to identify different cars. Watch them wiggle as if they're cheering you on during your shift!

### Advanced Collision-Avoidance System

We take safety seriously here. That's why our lot comes with a top-notch collision-avoidance system, allowing multiple cars to move simultaneously without any bumper-bashing. It's like having an invisible traffic conductor orchestrating the vehicular ballet.

### Floor Switching at Your Fingertips

Why be limited to one view? With our intuitive floor-switching feature, you can easily jump between different levels of the parking lot. It's seamless, it's smooth, and it lets you keep an eye on every corner of your domain.

### Fast-Forward Functionality

Got no time to wait? Just press the "Right Arrow" key and activate the fast-forward mode. It's perfect for those moments when you want to speed through the slower parts of your day.

### Gradual Color Transitions

Our parking lot is not just functional - it's also a visual treat. Enjoy the mesmerizing color transitions that add a touch of elegance and fun to your monitoring experience.

### The Shaking Teleport

Last but not least, the Teleport - our most unpredictable element. This strange portal not only changes colors but also shakes in a curious, almost mischievous way. It appears and disappears when you least expect it, adding a dash of mystery to your day.

*Embrace these features, and you'll find that managing this parking lot is not just a job, but an adventure! (and may become willing to give us some bonus)*

**Happy monitoring! May your shift be uneventful and your coffee cup always full.**
